Hi! My name is Chris. I am a software junky, football player, car enthusiast, and home chef based in Dallas, Texas. I am currently working as a Data Scientist for [Cleanlab](https://cleanlab.ai/about), working to bring data-centric AI to the whole world!

I briefly worked as a Product Analyst after I graduated, following interships at Google and Harvard Medical School. More information about these experiences can be found [here](/project).

# Childhood

I grew up in West Palm Beach, Florida with my younger brother, Matt. I have two amazing parents that inspire me every day. Until the age of 14, I lived on an equestrian complex that trained [show jumping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Show_jumping) horses. Growing up on a "farm" shaped me into the person that I am today - inquisitive, hard working, and passionate.

# Education

After graduating as Valedictorian of my high school, I attended MIT where I graduted with a Bachelors and Masters degree in Computer Science.

# Athletics

 I've played Quarterback my entire life, including [in highschool](http://www.hudl.com/video/3/3226540/5721cc06c124573b547265d5), and [at MIT](https://mitathletics.com/sports/football/roster/chris-mauck/9462). In high school, I broke numerous school records and achieved state, regional, and local accolades, finishng my career as a 2x District Champion, with 8600 yards and 85 TD passes. In college, I achieved numerous local accolades, finishing my career as a 2x NEWMAC Conference Champion, with 3100 yards, and 32 TD passes.
